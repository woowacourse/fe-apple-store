1. Price includes a $30 AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or Verizon discount. Available to qualified customers and
   requires 24-month installment loan when you select Citizens One or Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) as
   payment type at checkout at Apple. iPhone activation required with AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, or Verizon for
   purchases made with ACMI at an Apple Store. Subject to credit approval and credit limit. Taxes and shipping are
   not included in ACMI and are subject to your card’s variable APR. Additional Apple Card Monthly Installments terms
   are in the Customer Agreement. Additional iPhone Payments terms are here. ACMI is not available for purchases made
   online at special storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product will be the product's purchase price,
   less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. 2. $9.99/month after free trial. No commitment. Plan automatically renews after trial until cancelled. 3. Qualified Purchasers receive Promotion Savings when they purchase an eligible Mac or eligible iPad with
   eligible AirPods at a Qualifying Location. Only one Promotion Product per eligible Mac or eligible iPad per
   Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers selecting Apple Card
   Monthly Installments (“ACMI”) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
   eligible AirPods off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12
   months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan over 6
   months for the full price of the eligible AirPods. Qualified Purchasers will be charged for all items in their
   cart, including the eligible AirPods plus any additional Upgrade Cost. If you choose the pay-in-full or
   one-time-payment option for an ACMI eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout,
   that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included
   in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit
   limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 10.99% to 21.99% based on creditworthiness. Rates
